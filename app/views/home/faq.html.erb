  <h3>FAQ</h3>
  <h4>Why does the radio buttons for predicting the knockout stage match winners not show up in IE8?</h4>
  <p>Your are running the site in Compability Mode. This can be turned off by clicking the broken page icon
  next to the URL field. Alternatively, select "Compability View Settings" form the "Tools" menu, and remove
  "contestadors.com" from the list.</p>

  <h4>Why can I not see the other contest participants' predictions?</h4>
  <p>You will be able to see the predictions of the other contest participants when the Soccer Tournament starts. During
  the periode when users are allowed to set predictions, before the Soccer Tournament starts, their predictions will not
  be available for other users.</p>

  <h4>Why can I not deactivate participants from a contest I am the Administrator of?</h4>
  <p>You will be able to deactivate participants when the Soccer Tournament starts. Deactivated participants will not
  show up in the contest score table. For instance, you may want to deactivate participants not having completed
  their predictions or not having placed any predictions at all.</p>

  <h4>Can I sign in to my Contestadors account using different Identity Providers?</h4>
  <p>Yes, select "Account", and then "Sign In Options". Click the "Add Identity Provider For Contestadors Sign In" link,
  and select an Identity Provider in the appearing pop-up dialogue. Then sign in with your existing user for the selected
  provider. Repeat this procedure for any of the available Identity Providers you wish to sign in to your Contestadors account with.</p>
  <p>A point of warning here if you have more than one Contestadors account identified with different Identity Providers.
    Say you have two Contestadors accounts, A and B, for which you use your Twitter and Facebook accounts to sign in with, respectively.
    If you add your Facebook account as Identity Provider for your Contestadors account A as well, account A and B will be merged into one.
    The effect is that all your contest participations for the two Contestadors accounts will be kept under account A, for which
    you may now sign in with both Twitter and Facebook. However, your Contestadors account B, with any predictions you have
    placed there, will be deleted in this case.</p>
