  <p><b>Contestadors</b> will update a <b>score table</b> for each contest during the UEFA Euro 2016 Soccer Tournament. A score table
    will rank the contest participants according to the points they have received so far for predictions of completed matches and
    knockout stages. Two contest members with the same prediction score will be given the same ranking in the score table. </p>

  <p>A contest administrator may <b>deactivate</b> participants, including him- or herself, with the effect that the deactivated participants
  will not appear in the contest score table. E.g., participants not having predicted the tournament completely might be disqualified from the
  contest if the administrator decides to do so. However, this function is reversible. I.e., the administrator might <b>reactivate</b> participants that
  have been deactivated earlier, making these participants once again appear in the contest score table.</p>

  <p>A score in the range of <b>0 - 500</b> points is rewarded to a user depending on how well his or hers predictions meet the
    actual outcome of the UEFA Euro 2016 Soccer Tournament. Only objectives being predicted can add possible points to a user's
    prediction score. Thus, if a user has not completely predicted the tournament, the maximum score of 500 points will not be obtainable.
    The following table shows how <b>Contestadors</b> adds points to prediction scores during the tournament:</p>
