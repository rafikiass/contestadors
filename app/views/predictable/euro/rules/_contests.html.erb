  <p>A <b>contest</b> may consist of any number of <b>Contestadors</b> users, competing against each other based on
    their corresponding predictions of the UEFA Euro 2012 Soccer Tournament. Any user may create new contests. The
    user creating a contest automatically becomes its <b>administrator</b>, with the special rights of <b>inviting</b> other people
    to join the contest as <b>participants</b>. A participant having joined a contest after receiving an invitation from its administrator
    is said to be a contest <b>member</b>. Both the administrator of a contest and its invited members are referred to as participants.</p>

  <p>Invitations are sent on email by <b>Contestadors</b> on behalf of the contest
    administrator providing details of names and email addresses for the people to invite as members. If an invitation is accepted,
    the invite√© becomes a participant of the contest he or she was invited to. A person, identified by his or hers email, can only be
    invited once for each contest. Furthermore, the administrator of a contest is not allowed to invite him- or herself as a regular contest
    member by providing the email of his or hers user account. I.e., a participant can only have one role in the contest, either as
    administrator or member.</p>

  <p>A <b>Contestadors</b> user may participate in any number of contests, entering each with the same tournament
    predictions. Predictions set by each contest member will become visible to all other contest participants when the
    tournament starts.</p>
